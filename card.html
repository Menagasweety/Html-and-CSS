            <p>Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you, and with every living creature
                that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out
                of the ark . . . that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again
                shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” (Genesis 9:8-11)</p>
